# Couch to Coder 2024

## About 

Welcome! This repository contains my work for the Couch to Coder 2024 summer coding camp, a program designed to take participants from complete beginners to confident coders.

Before this program, I already had lots of coding experience, from both my degree and personal projects. I joined Couch to Coder to refresh and strengthen my existing skills (especially CSS layouts!), receive feedback and network with fellow coders, graduates, and industry. 

## Goals

By participating in Couch to Coder 2024, I aim to:
1. Refresh and reinforce my existing coding skills
2. Learn about any new trends or practices in software development
3. Expand my professional network in the tech industry
4. Collaborate with fellow participants and mentors
5. Contribute to discussions and share my experience with newer coders

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to contain all tasks, websites, coursework, and other materials from the Couch to Coder 2024 program. It's organized by the days of the course:

Each day's folder contains the relevant tasks, code, and any websites or projects worked on during that session.
