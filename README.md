# Couch to Coder 2024

## About 

Welcome. This repository contains my work for the Couch to Coder 2024 summer coding camp, a program designed to take participants from complete beginners to confident coders in just five weeks.

Before this program, I already had lots of coding experience, from both my degree and personal projects. I decided to join the program as a way to refresh and strengthen my existing skills, especially in areas like CSS layouts! Also joined to network with fellow coders, graduates and members in industry. It was also a good chance to get feedback on my existing code, and fill in missing gaps. 

## Goals

By participating in Couch to Coder 2024, I aim to:
1. Refresh and reinforce my existing coding skills
2. Learn about any new trends or practices in software development
3. Expand my professional network in the tech industry
4. Collaborate with fellow participants and mentors
5. Contribute to discussions and share my experience with newer coders
